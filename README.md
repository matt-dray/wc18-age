How many players at the 2018 FIFA World Cup 2018 were younger than you? 

## What?

There's a still a chance you can make it as a footballer, right? No. Many pros are probably young enough to be your child. Use this app as a surefire way to make yourself feel old.

Some testimonials from colleagues:

> Very depressing

> I knew I was too old to become a great footballer

> Just what I needed to see

Access the app [live on shinyapps.io](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/) (hosted on a free account, so will max out after 25 hours of use per month) and you can also [read the accompanying blog post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/07/17/world-cup-age-app/).

Alternatively, you can run the app from an R session with:

``` r
shiny::runGitHub("wc18-age", "matt-dray")
```

The app depends on the packages {shiny}, {shinythemes} and {DT}.
